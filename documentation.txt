    the function receives a number of atributes, according to the atributes present in the
    model 'res.partner' of yout odoo database.
    By default we have the basic atributes:

        name=Felipe-street=rua rosa-website=umsitelegal.org

    To see what other atributes are available you need to add "?debug=" right after web at your odoo url

    First the method gets the sale orders. 

    Them divides them into two lists, one list contains the sale orders whose atribute ['state']=sale, other ['state']=draft.

    It returns two percents, the first one is absolute, it considers only the number os drafts and sales
    Ex: 2 sales and 1 drafts
        absolutPercent = 2/(2+1) = 0.66 --> 66% sales and 33% drafts

    the second is pricePercent, it takes in consideration the price of each sale.

    Ex: 2 sales, R$10,00 each, one draft, R$ 30,00

    pricePercent = (10+10)/(30+10+10) = 0.4 --> 40% sales and 60% drafts 
###################

        create_date[5:7]=09

    Then the method sums all the 'amount_total' corresponding to the selected month
